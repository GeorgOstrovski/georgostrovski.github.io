## About me


<img src="data/pic.jpg" alt="My younger self" width="300" height="413" align="right">

I am a Research Engineering Team Lead at <a href="http://deepmind.com/">DeepMind</a> in London,
working on problems related to Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Before that, I completed a PhD in mathematics under the supervision of
[Prof. Sebastian van Strien](http://www2.imperial.ac.uk/~svanstri/) at the University of Warwick.
My PhD research revolved around Dynamical Systems in Game Theory, in particular

* Fictitious Play Dynamics and related learning processes in games (their asymptotic properties, convergence rates, combinatorial description, emergence of chaos)

* the dynamics of piecewise affine maps and flows (combinatorial description, ergodic properties)
